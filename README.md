## Prerequisite

### Setup Development Environment

1. Install NodeJS LTS(Latest Stable Version) from [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Instal the latest version of [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/).

    ```shell
    corepack enable
    ```

    This will install pnpm on your system. However, it probably would not be the latest version. Hence, to upgrade it, check the [latest pnpm version](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/latest) and run:

    ```shell
    corepack prepare pnpm@<version> --activate
    ```

    Or, follow the other [recommended installation options](https://pnpm.io/installation).

3. Install Maven from [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
4. Install JDK 11 [https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads).

### Download WSO2 Identity Server

In order to setup this repository locally, you need to have [WSO2 Identity Server](https://wso2.com/identity-server/) installed on your local environment.

We recommend you to download the [latest release](https://github.com/wso2/product-is/releases) or build the [product-is](https://github.com/wso2/product-is) from [source](https://github.com/wso2/product-is#building-the-distribution-from-source).

### Setup WSO2 Identity Server

#### Allow CORS Origins

Add the following code to `repository/conf/deployment.toml` in `WSO2 Identity Server` distribution pack to allow CORS.

```toml
[cors]
allowed_origins = [
    "https://localhost:9000",
    "https://localhost:9001"
]
supported_methods = [
    "GET",
    "POST",
    "HEAD",
    "OPTIONS",
    "PUT",
    "PATCH",
    "HEAD",
    "DELETE",
    "PATCH"
]
exposed_headers = [ "Location" ]
```

#### Configure FIDO2 origins

Add your hostname and port as a trusted FIDO2 origin to the `deployment.toml` file as given below.

```toml
[fido.trusted]
origins=["https://localhost:9000"]
```

#### Make Applications Editable

Currently, `Console` & `My Account` are considered as system applications hence they are readonly by default. In order configure them, you need to add the following config to the `deployment.toml` file to override the default behavior.

```toml
[system_applications]
read_only_apps = []
```

#### Start the Identity Server

Now you can go ahead and start the Identity Server that was downloaded in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisite) step.

For instructions on startup, [read the docs](https://is.docs.wso2.com/en/latest/deploy/get-started/run-the-product/).

#### Go to Management Console

Navigate to the Management Console i.e `https://localhost:9443/carbon/` from the browser, and login to the system by entering an admin password.

> ðŸ’¡ You can find out the default password details here: [https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Configuring+the+System+Administrator](https://docs.wso2.com/display/ADMIN44x/Configuring+the+System+Administrator)

#### Configure Callback URLs

In the Management Console, navigate to `Service Providers -> List` from left side panel. And then go to `Edit` option in the application that you want to configure in dev mode (ex: `MY_ACCOUNT`). Then click on `Inbound Authentication Configuration -> OAuth/OpenID Connect Configuration -> Edit`. And then update the `Callback Url` field with below corresponding values.

##### Console

```shell
regexp=(https://localhost:9443/console|https://localhost:9443/t/(.*)/console|https://localhost:9443/console/login|https://localhost:9443/t/(.*)/console/login|https://localhost:9001/console|https://localhost:9001/t/(.*)/console|https://localhost:9001/console/login|https://localhost:9001/t/(.*)/console/login)
```

##### My Account

```shell
regexp=(https://localhost:9443/myaccount|https://localhost:9443/t/(.*)/myaccount|https://localhost:9443/myaccount/login|https://localhost:9443/t/(.*)/myaccount/login|https://localhost:9000/myaccount|https://localhost:9000/t/(.*)/myaccount|https://localhost:9000/myaccount/login|https://localhost:9000/t/(.*)/myaccount/login)
```

## Build & Run

### Build

Clone or download the Identity Apps repository and run the following commands from the command line in the project root directory (where the `package.json` is located) to build all the packages with dependencies.

```shell
# From project root.
mvn clean install
```

### Run

To start the apps in development mode, execute the following commands accordingly.

#### Console

```shell
# To start Console
cd apps/console
pnpm start
```

Once the development server is live, you can access the application via [https://localhost:9001/console](https://localhost:9001/console).

#### My Account

```shell
# To start My Account
cd apps/myaccount
pnpm start
```

Once the development server is live, you can access the application via [https://localhost:9000/myaccount](https://localhost:9000/myaccount).
