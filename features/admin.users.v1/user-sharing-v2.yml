  description: |-
    This document defines the **User Sharing REST API (v2)** for organizations in **WSO2 Identity Server**.
    It follows the same pattern as **Application Sharing** and enables organization administrators to:
    - Share users across child organizations.
    - Configure per-organization user role assignments.
    - Manage and revoke shared access.
    - Retrieve a user's shared organizations and effective roles.
